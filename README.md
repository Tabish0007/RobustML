# RobustML: Adversarially Robust Machine Learning

## Project Structure
- `datasets/` – Load and preprocess datasets
- `models/` – Model architectures
- `attacks/` – Adversarial attack implementations
- `defenses/` – Defense strategies
- `train.py` – Train the model
- `test_attack.py` – Test adversarial attacks
- `benchmark.py` – Evaluate attacks and defenses
- `streamlit_app/` – Interactive demo

## Getting Started
1. Create virtual environment (Python 3.11 recommended)
2. Activate environment
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `train.py` to train the model
5. Run `test_attack.py` to generate adversarial images
